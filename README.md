# graphiq-troll-challenge
my solution to the graphiq (formerly known as findthebest.com) coding challenge. warning: this solves it with depth first search. they want something faster.<br>
try seeing if you can solve it with breadth first search or see if it's possible to implement a* search.<br>
solution is in solution.js
